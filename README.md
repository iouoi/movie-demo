### Step 2
Setup the Website

1. `git clone https://github.com/reactFiberline/movie-demo.git`
2. No need to install dependencies (which is why it's so big)
3. `cd movie-demo`
4. `npm start`

### Step 3
Inspect the website.

The demo will run on `localhost:3000`, just make sure you have the extension running in chrome.
